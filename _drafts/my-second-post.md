You'll find this post in your `_drafts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build
the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but
the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and
auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new drafts, simply add a file in the `_drafts` directory that follows the
convention `name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. As these
files are published yet, the name doesn't need to be prepended with the publication
date. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.
